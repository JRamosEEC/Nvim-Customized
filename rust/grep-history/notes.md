TODO:
This will be the start of the rust app to manage search history and grep parsing when previewed.
I'm going to experiment to see if it's faster to RPC the data including parsing on preview.
This might provide bonusses where I can bring back the previewer perks like icons.
I'm thinking maybe like a batched parser on preview that does the visible entries and a page a head and loads the icons like we used to have (If it's possible to "re-render" picker)
